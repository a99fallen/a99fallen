Obiekt typu `Announcer` tworzymy w klasie `BattleshipsApp` w metodzie `main`:

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Tworzenie graczy
        Player playerOne = new Player(new SimpleLogic());
        playerOne.setName("Leszek");

        Player playerTwo = new Player(new SimpleLogic());
        playerTwo.setName("Wojtek");

        // Uruchomienie gry
        GameEngine engine = new GameEngine();
        Announcer announcer = new Announcer();
        engine.setAnnouncer(announcer);
        engine.prepareGame(playerOne, playerTwo);
        engine.prepareBoards();

        System.out.println("Plansza pierwszego gracza:");
        printBoard(playerOne.getBoard());

        System.out.println("\nPlansza drugiego gracza:");
        printBoard(playerTwo.getBoard());

        engine.startGame();

        // Prezentacja wyników
        GameResult result = engine.getGameResult();
        System.out.println("\nWynik gry: " + result);
    }
```
